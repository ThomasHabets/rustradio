/*! NRZI â€” Non return to zero

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero>

The same effect as NrziDecode can be had by doing:

```text
let (a, b) = add_block![g, Tee::new(prev)];
let delay = add_block![g, Delay::new(a, 1)];
let prev = add_block![g, Xor::new(delay, b)];
let prev = add_block![g, XorConst::new(prev, 1u8)];
```

"NRZI" is actually ambiguous as to which is zero and which is
one. This code is going with NRZI-S, meaning a toggle is zero, and
constant is one, because that's what done by AX.25, both 1200bps Bell
202, and 9600 G3RUH.
