//! NRZI â€” Non return to zero
use crate::stream::{ReadStream, WriteStream};

/// NRZI decoder.
///
/// <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero>
///
/// The same effect as NrziDecode can be had by doing:
///
/// ```text
/// let (prev, b) = blockchain![g, prev, Tee::new(prev)];
/// let prev = blockchain![
///     g,
///     prev,
///     Delay::new(prev, 1),
///     Xor::new(delay, b),
///     XorConst::new(prev, 1u8),
/// ];
/// ```
///
/// "NRZI" is actually ambiguous as to which is zero and which is
/// one. This code is going with NRZI-S, meaning a toggle is zero, and
/// constant is one, because that's what done by AX.25, both 1200bps Bell
/// 202, and 9600 G3RUH.
