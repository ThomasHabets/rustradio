    use `w`.

    Consuming data from `r` involves first reading it, and then
    "consuming" from the stream. If a `consume()` (or `clear()`) is
    not called on the stream, the same data will continue to be read
    forever.

    Writing data to streams in `w` only involves calling `.write()` on
    the stream.

/** Macro to make it easier to write one-for-one blocks.

Output type must be the same as the input type.

The first argument is the block struct name. The second (and beyond)
are traits that T must match.

`process_one(&mut self, s: &T) -> T` must be implemented by the block.

E.g.:
* [Add][add] or multiply by some constant, or negate.
* Delay, `o[n] = o[n] - o[n-1]`, or [IIR filter][iir]. These require state,
  but can process only one sample at a time.
