/// Quadrature demod, the core of an FM demodulator.
///
/// Quadrature demodulation works is best done by thinking of the samples
/// as vectors going out of the origin on the complex plane.
///
/// A zero frequency means no "spinning" around the origin, but with all
/// samples just being on a vector, with the same angle, though possibly
/// varying magnitude.
///
/// Negative frequency means the vector is spinning counter
/// clockwise. Positive frequency means spinning clockwise.
///
/// Quadrature demodulation discards the magnitude of the vector, and just
/// looks at the angle between the current sample, and the previous
/// sample.
///
/// Because magnitude is discarded, this block is only useful for decoding
/// frequency changes (FM, FSK, â€¦), not things like QAM.
///
/// [This article][vectorized] gives some good illustrations.
///
/// Enabling the `fast-math` feature (dependency) speeds up
/// QuadratureDemod by about 4x.

/// A faster version of FM demodulation, that makes some assumptions.

/// This block can be used instead of a `QuadratureDemod` block, for
/// performance. It's much faster (~4x compared to the fast-math
/// version of `QuadratureDemod`), but it's less good.
///
/// The algorithm is taken from Lyons, Understanding Digital Signal
/// Processing, third edition, page 760.
///
/// This is the faster version of the two, which assumes all
/// frequencies are constant amplitude. This means it can be used to
/// e.g. demodulate an FM carrier for 1200bps AX.25, but *not* to
/// decode the preemphasized bell 202 inside.
///
/// You could deemphasize, if you know all transmitters preemp
/// parameters.
///
/// For 9600bps AX.25 it works fine, if the sample rate is high
/// enough. At 50ksps QuadratureDemod works well, but FastFM does
/// not. At 500ksps FastFM performs just as well in my tests. But
/// FastFM at 500ksps is about half the speed of QuadratureDemod at
/// 50ksps.
///
/// Really, just use `QuadratureDemod` unless it's shown to be too slow
/// for your use case.
///
/// Lyons has an more general version of this algorithm, also on page
/// 760, but it's not implemented here.
